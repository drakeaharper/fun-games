## UI/UX Design Specifications

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Deep blue (#1e3a8a) for main UI elements
- **Secondary**: Gold (#fbbf24) for highlights and important info
- **Success**: Green (#10b981) for positive stock movements  
- **Danger**: Red (#ef4444) for negative stock movements
- **Background**: Light gray (#f9fafb) with white panels
- **Text**: Dark gray (#374151) for readability

### Typography
- **Headers**: Bold, larger font for game title and section headers
- **Body**: Clean, readable font for game information
- **Numbers**: Monospace font for prices and quantities
- **Buttons**: Clear, action-oriented text

### Layout Principles
- **Information Hierarchy**: Most important info (stocks, portfolio) prominently displayed
- **Logical Flow**: Left-to-right flow from stocks → dice → portfolio
- **White Space**: Adequate spacing to avoid cluttered appearance
- **Consistency**: Uniform spacing, colors, and component styles

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management Structure
```typescript
interface GameUIState {
  currentPlayer: Player;
  gamePhase: 'rolling' | 'trading' | 'gameOver';
  selectedStock?: StockType;
  isRolling: boolean;
  lastDiceResult?: DiceRoll;
  notifications: Notification[];
}
```

### Key Components Hierarchy
- `App` (root component)
  - `GameBoard` (main game area)
    - `StockDisplay` (stock cards grid)
    - `DiceArea` (dice rolling interface)  
    - `PlayerPortfolio` (portfolio management)
  - `TradingModal` (buy/sell interface)
  - `GameMenu` (settings and controls)
  - `NotificationSystem` (toast messages)

## Testing Strategy
- **Component Tests**: Test individual UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Test user workflows and interactions
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Ensure UI consistency
